# Vapor-liquid-equilibrium-modeling

This repository contains MATLAB routines for:

*Saturation pressure modeling for pure ethanol and cyclohexane.
*Parameter estimation for the alpha cohesion function in the Peng-Robinson equation of state.
*Vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) modeling of the cyclohexane-ethanol binary system using the Peng-Robinson and UNIFAC models.
*Optimization of group interaction parameters in the UNIFAC and UNIFAC-Do model.

The codes are organized to facilitate the reproduction of calculations presented in the study.
